# Exploratory Data Analysis – Store 1

## Project Overview
In the fourth stage of the Store 1 project, the focus is on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas. This sprint builds on the cleaned and structured datasets from previous stages to explore patterns, distributions, and relationships within customer data.

The analysis aims to uncover insights that support data-driven decision-making and prepare the foundation for reporting and visualization.

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis to:
- Understand the structure and distribution of customer data.
- Identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.
- Detect anomalies and potential data quality issues.
- Generate insights to guide future analysis and business strategies.

## Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistics of customer data.
- Analysis of distributions and key metrics.
- Exploration of relationships between customer attributes.
- Identification of trends and outliers in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer information from Store 1, processed and refined throughout previous sprints to ensure consistency and analytical reliability.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory data analysis techniques

## Business Value
This exploratory analysis helps Store 1:
- Gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
- Identify actionable insights before advanced modeling or reporting.
- Support strategic marketing and operational decisions.

This sprint strengthens the analytical foundation required for advanced data analysis and visualization in subsequent project stages.
